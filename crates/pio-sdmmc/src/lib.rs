//! Native four-bit SD card host.
//!
//! Three layers, one seam:
//!
//! - [`proto`]: the SD protocol as pure functions. Command frames, CRC7, the four-line CRC16,
//!   responses and card registers. No hardware, no time, no allocation.
//! - [`card`]: the card driver. Identification, block reads and writes, error recovery. It talks
//!   to hardware only through [`Bus`].
//! - A bus back-end that implements [`Bus`]: the PIO + DMA bus for embassy-rp, or the simulated
//!   card in the `sim` module (feature `sim`) for host tests.
//!
//! [`Bus`] is a deliberately dumb pipe. Every protocol decision and every integrity check lives
//! above it, so all of it runs and is tested on the host.
